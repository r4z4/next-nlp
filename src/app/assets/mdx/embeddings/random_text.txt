One of my projects is nearing its last stretch. I’m super tired and I need a day or two away from computers before I can handle that final stretch. So tomorrow I’m going gift shopping!

I would’ve loved loved LOVED some vacation but alas the stars have not aligned and there’s no way I can take a vacation now. However, I really needed a change of scenery to avoid the rapidly-approaching burnout, so I’m gonna spend the next week working from Chania, my second home. I’m gonna visit some friends there and I can’t show up empty-handed, so I’m probably gonna go hunt for some small gifts tomorrow, too. Nothing fancy, we have this routine where we each show up with homemade jam/brandy/whatever, but last year I also brought some local cheese and it was a blast, so I’ll see if I can pick up something else that’s good.

Then I’m off to watch the Champions League final. I missed most of this season (tough year…) and I don’t watch that much football these days, but these things are still kind of special to me because nostalgia is a hell of a drug. I missed only one final in the last 24 years, and I had a pretty good excuse for it (I, uh, got married on that day).
